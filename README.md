# Terraform_lab
Terraform is an open-source tool to make test script development less harden by incorporating machine learning algorthms. This tool will learn the test scripts already created and create new feature fiile (if Cucumber BDD is using) and step definitions.  

The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.
